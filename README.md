# UMBC Interactive Map

## What is it?

We made an interactive map that lets you know
which restaurants are open and which parking
zones are available for each parking permit type.

You no longer have to search DineOnCampus for the table of
hours to know which restaurants on campus are open; it's displayed
for you on our website.

It may be particularly helpful for new students and staff/faculty, as well as
those who are visiting campus temporarily.

## Components

The website runs primarily on Python. 

This project uses Flask and Folium.
Folium is used for the map data, which it pulls from OpenStreetMaps.
Flask interoperates with Folium and the rest of the website.

It makes queries from DineOnCampus for the times and dates
of restaurant closings.

It's hosted using Azure.

## Challenges

None of us had used Folium before,
nor had any of us hosted a website
on a real server before.
Two of us had never used Flask.
On top of that, this was our first hackathon ever.
It has definitely been a head-first learning experience for us.
We're looking forward to participating in more in the future, if possible.
